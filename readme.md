# Stem

System information visualizer.

It uses [@kitajs/html](https://github.com/kitajs/html) together with [`Bun`](https://bun.sh) to build & open a simple `index.html` containing all the information you need to know about your system (CPU, Memory, GPU etc).

It's fast, minimal and it only provides static information.

## Requirements
